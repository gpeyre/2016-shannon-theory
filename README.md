![Shannon's logo](img/shannon-256.png)

For now, the article is only [available in french](http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01343890).

The Matlab Jupyter notebook can be [viewed online from here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gpeyre/2016-shannon-theory/blob/master/code/data_compression.ipynb).

- The main file is data_compression.ipynb, which is a Matlab Jupyter notebook presenting the Matlab code
to reproduce the figure of the articles.
- logo/ contains the code to reproduce the logo of the article.
- toolbox/ is mostly code from [the numerical tours](http://www.numerical-tours.com) to perform the Huffman coding and tree vizualization.
